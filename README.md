# Python Geospatial Foundations (geopy-foundations)

This project explores foundational concepts and libraries within the Python geospatial ecosystem using Jupyter Notebooks. It's designed to guide users through reading, manipulating, and visualizing both vector and raster spatial data.

## Phases

1.  **Phase 1: Foundations (`01_foundations.ipynb`)**
    *   Introduces core libraries: `geopandas`, `rasterio`, `shapely`, `pyproj`, `matplotlib`, `osmnx`, `requests`.
    *   Demonstrates loading vector data (Natural Earth shapefile) and raster data (NASA Blue Marble).
    *   Shows basic plotting and data download using `osmnx` and `requests`.

2.  **Phase 2: Spatial Data Handling and GIS Operations (`02_phase2_spatial_handling.ipynb`)**
    *   Focuses on vector operations (reading, writing, creating geometries) with `geopandas`.
    *   Covers raster operations (reading, writing) with `rasterio`.
    *   Explains Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS) checking and reprojection.
    *   Implements spatial operations like buffering and spatial joins.

## Setup

This project uses `uv` for dependency management.

1.  **Clone the repository (if you haven't already):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mharsalan1/geopy-foundations.git
    cd geopy-foundations
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Ensure you have `uv` installed (`pip install uv`). Then run:
    ```bash
    uv pip install geopandas pandas rasterio fiona shapely pyproj matplotlib requests osmnx Pillow jupyterlab
    ```
    *(Note: `jupyterlab` is included to run the notebooks easily)*

## Running the Notebooks

1.  **Start JupyterLab:**
    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    ```
2.  Navigate to the `notebooks` directory in the JupyterLab interface.
3.  Open and run the notebooks (`01_foundations.ipynb`, `02_phase2_spatial_handling.ipynb`) cell by cell.

**Note:** The notebooks download necessary data files (like shapefiles and images) during execution. These files are placed in the `notebooks` directory or subdirectories and are ignored by Git via the `.gitignore` file. Output files generated by the notebooks (like `world_countries.shp` or `new_raster.tif`) are saved in the `data/` directory, which is also ignored by Git.
